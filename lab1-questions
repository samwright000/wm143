1) Change the the ip address of the destination to 203.0.113.1 - Done

2) Change the source ip address to match the you VM guest's ip address

3) Change the source ip and MAC addresses to match your bare-metal < Done host and the destination ip and MAC addresses to match your bare-metal host's gateway machine . 

4) Starting from your answer to 3, construct a pcap file with two frames: frame 1 as in Q3, and frame 2 going in the opposite direction precisely 1 second later.

5) Change the timezone but still have the packets from 3 occur at the same time.

6) Change the UDP source and or destination ports to mimic a DNS request (do not try and make the UDP payload genuine DNS, only the UDP header).




Extension questions for anyone insufficiently challenged so far:
E1) From the original, try making the ip payload TCP syn packet rather than UDP.

E2) Extend E1 to include the SYN+ACK response 100 miliseconds later.

E3) Extend E2 to conclude the three way handshake 150 milliseconds later.

E4) Extend E3 to send "Hello, World!"

E5) Extend E4 to close the connection.

E6) Try to IP fragment the original "Hello, World!" UDP datagram into two. Manipulate the break to occur where you chose. 

E7) Experiment with non-conformant frames, packets, datagrams, segments.

E8) Do any of the above but into pcap-ng format

E9) Define interesting, small scale problems for others to tackle
